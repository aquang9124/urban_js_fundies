		// In most cases the value of 'this' is determined by how a function is called
		/*
			When 'this' is used in the global execution context, meaning whenever
			'this' is referred to outside of ANY function, 'this' is referring to
			the global object. For web browsers the global object is the window object.
			The window object is any open window in a browser.
		*/

		// ----- Examples of 'this' in the global execution context ----- //

		console.log(this === window); 
		// This prints true because 'this' is being referenced in the global context
		// and thus it is referencing the window object.
		console.log(this.document == document);
		// This line will return true also because when a HTML document has been fully 
		// loaded into a web browser it becomes a document object. The document is a part of
		// the global window object so it can be accessed with the syntax window.document.
		// this === window so this.document is the same as saying window.document.

		this.a = 37;
		console.log(window.a);
		// 37 will be logged to the console. Again, this === window when referenced outside of a function
		// so window.a is the same as this.a.
		
		// ----- Examples of 'this' in the function context ---- //

		function foo() {
			return this;
		}

		console.log(foo() === window);
		// This will print true because when Javascript is not in strict mode
		// the value of 'this' must always default to the global object.
		// Again, when we're talking about web browsers, window is the global object.

		function foo2() {
			"use strict";
			return this;
		}

		console.log(foo2() === undefined);
		// In strict mode the value of 'this' remains whatever it was set to.
		// Because 'this' was never set to anything it is undefined.
		// Strict mode basically makes it so that bad code give you errors
		// instead of in normal JS where JS will try its darndest
		// to run.

		// ----- Examples of 'this' when a function is called as an object method ----- //

		/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------

		When a function is called as a method of an object, its 'this' is
		set to the object the method is called on. That's why a private method
		cannot access 'this'. It's because the private method is not directly 
		called by the object. The private method is called by another method 
		and so it's 'this' is not set to reference the object that you want it to 
		reference. 

		----------------------------------------------------------------------- */

		function testObs() {
			var self = this;
			this.nums = 37;
			this.getNums = function() {
				return this.nums;
			};
			var setNums = function(num) {
				self.nums = num;
			};
			this.changeNums = function(num) {
				setNums(num);
			};
		}

		var obbie = new testObs();

		// Tip: When a function is used as a constructor with the 'new' keyword, 
		// like in this example, its 'this' is bound to the new object that is being constructed.
		// So in this context, 'this' == obbie. Self is a variable that references 'this' so,
		// for this particular instance, 'self' will always be pointing to obbie.

		console.log(obbie.getNums()); 
		// Console logs 37

		console.log(obbie.nums);
		// It also logs 37

		obbie.changeNums(36);
		console.log(obbie.getNums());

		// Here we use changeNums() in order to invoke setNums which will update the value
		// of nums. Technically, since nums is not private, we could just access nums directly
		// and change its value.

		obbie.nums = 24;
		console.log(obbie.nums);

		// Outputs 24, you get the idea.
