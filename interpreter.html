		// Problem 1
		var first_variable; // first_variable is hoisted to the top
		console.log(first_variable); // This will output undefined
		first_variable = "Yipee I was first!"; 

		function firstFunc() {
			first_variable = "Not anymore!"; // This refers to the global first_variable because it will not be able to find
											 // a first_variable in the local function scope
			console.log(first_variable);
		}

		console.log(first_variable); // The output will be 'Yipee I was first!'

		// Problem 2
		var food = "Chicken"; // Variable declaration and assignment

		function eat() {
			var food; // Food is hoisted up to the top
			food = "half-chicken"; // It is then assigned to half-chicken
			console.log(food);
			food = "gone"; // Now food is assigned to gone
		}

		eat(); // This will console log 'half-chicken' and set the local variable food to 'gone'
		console.log(food); // This will output as 'Chicken' because the global food was not changed

		// Problem 3
		var new_word = "NEW!";

		function lastFunc() {
			new_word = "old";
		}
		// Output will be 'NEW!'
		// The function lastFunc was not called so new_word never actually changes
		console.log(new_word);
